The second dataset should be the vehicle collision record, with variables timestamp, and collision location. Each dataset should have at least 1000 observations. For the parking data set, daily 1 hour frequent intervals would be ideal.  The preferred data structure is tabular, and it should come from official government or campus sources to ensure its reliability.\n",
    "2. We located two datasets that could potentially work for our proposed project. [One dataset is from UCSD](https://rmp-wapps.ucsd.edu/TS/Survey/Survey%20of%20Parking%20Space%20Occupancy%20Levels/Quarterly%20Tables/Contents.html), and details the amount of parking occupancy available on campus by quarter. The [second data set](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-collisions-details/) is from the County of San Diego, and details traffic incident information from 2015-2023, which contains 123708 pieces of observations (incidents) total.\n"

    "Our proposed project involves the analysis of data related to parking occupancy on the UCSD campus and traffic incidents on nearby major roads. As we conduct our analysis, we are aware of the importance of ethical standards and privacy concerns. [Deon’s ethics checklist](https://deon.drivendata.org/#data-science-ethics-checklist) provides a useful framework for investigating potential ethics or privacy issues. \n",

    "In order to avoid potential bias within our datasets, we are only utilizing datasets that are public domain and published by reputable sources. For instance, our proposed dataset providing accident information is published by the San Diego government, and our proposed dataset with UCSD parking data is published by UCSD campus authorities. The traffic incident information is not directly collected from individuals, but instead published to public domain at the time of the accident when collected. We acknowledge that some information available in the dataset may be sensitive, though not personally identifying information (PII), and we are excluding this information from our analysis. The parking occupancy data is collected by [“cameras embedded with artificial intelligence”](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/parking-on-campus-theres-an-app-for-that#:~:text=IT%20Services%20enlisted%20student%20developers,which%20parking%20spaces%20are%20available).
