    "Traffic incidents are always a significant concern in modern cities, especially in densely populated areas. As a large institution with a growing population, the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) campus tackles the problems brought by heavy vehicular traffic and parking. As the campus community grows, the parking occupancy rates may reflect the number of traffic incidents happening around the campus area. Our study seeks to find out whether there’s a correlation between the UCSD campus parking occupancy rates and the traffic incidents happening surrounding campus. \n",
    "\n",
    "While our topic is mainly focused on how parking occupancy may predict the occurrence of traffic collisions within the area of UCSD, there have been prior studies that analyze the likelihood of car accidents occurring in a given geographic region. For example, Forbes Advisor compiled a list of the top 50 U.S. cities with the highest likelihood of getting into a car accident, with San Diego being one of them.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This ranking system was determined by data for fatality rate per 100,000 people from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration and average years between collisions and relative collision likelihood from the AllState Best Drivers Index. This data analysis only focuses on urban cities, which means the dataset is relatively small as only the 50 largest cities by population from census data were chosen. A general understanding of a particular city's collision danger is approximated by comparison to other major cities in the dataset. Forbes Advisor’s primary goal is providing financial advice, which this data analysis does by offering relevant information about collisions that may involve insurance, lawyer/attorney, and risk assessment situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another study investigated the causal relationship between road density and parking occupancy.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Tunisian researchers conducted a research paper to investigate the causal relationship between road density and parking occupancy in Tunis city center using Granger causality tests based on vector error correction modeling. The authors collected data using video cameras around a major street in the capital of Tunis, and found that there does exist a causal relationship between road density and parking occupancy, with road density Granger-causing parking occupancy. This suggests that increasing road density may lead to an increase in parking occupancy, which in turn may lead to an increase in road congestion. The authors suggest that their findings can be used to develop more sustainable parking policies that reduce road congestion and can be incorporated into parking models to improve their accuracy and effectiveness. This study provides important insights into the relationship between road density and parking occupancy, and gives us some ideas for our own project since road density and traffic incidents are two significant features of a city’s traffic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we want to assess what the general level of safety associated with traffic collisions might be through exploring a more confined geographical area that is of interest to us, UCSD. Based upon these prior works and the UCSD campus parking occupancy and nearby traffic incidence data, our project aims to identify patterns specific to UCSD campus and its surrounding areas. We will conduct a descriptive and exploratory data analysis of these datasets, which will allow us to identify important features of the datasets and how they may relate to one another. We aim to contribute to the existing literature on road safety and how it impacts us on the UCSD campus. \n",
